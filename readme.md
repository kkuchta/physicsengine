## Baller.js

Just a simple physics engine I've been hacking on.  It started as just a moving ball to try out html5 canvas, but I decided the ball should bounce.  Then it should bounce more realistically (gravity/drag/friction), and in multiple dimensions.  Then I decided I might as well do arbitrary vector forces.  Then I decided that (since I could easily do thousands of balls), I should do some collision detection (which I should overoptimize with grid-based detection).

Anyway, don't actually use this as either real code or a reference- it's buggy and in a constant state of flux, since it's only for fun.
